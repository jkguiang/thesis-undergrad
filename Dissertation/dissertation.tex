%=== Introduction ============================================
\chapter{Introduction}

Over the last century, the Standard Model (SM) has been shown to be the most accurate description of the fundamental construction and operation of the universe, but it is still incomplete, giving rise to many theories including Supersymmetry (SUSY), a popular extension of the Standard Model. It predicts a partner particle to every SM particle, which would resolve some particularly bothersome issues with the Standard Model like fixing the mass of the Higgs Boson, the identity of Dark Matter, and many others. Assuming SUSY is real, supersymmetric particles are expected to appear in high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Particle Collider (LHC). However, direct evidence for SUSY, or for any other competing theory, has yet to be discovered, thus motivating the continual development of the LHC and of the field of High Energy physics as a whole. Progress at the LHC is due to two fundamentally connected and absolutely essential aspects of High Energy physics: detector design and data analysis - the detector provides the data, but the analysis makes it useful. As such, developments on both sides of the process offer the potential for finding new physics.

\chapter{The CMS Detector}{\label{appendix:a}}
\begin{section}{Design}

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general purpose detector at the LHC, meaning it probes for the existence of a variety of new physics. The detector's namesake is a ``compact'' solenoid, the largest superconducting magnet ever built (with a length of 15m and diameter of 7m), that generates a 4T magnetic field - strong enough to pull many high-energy, charged particles produced in a proton-proton collision towards CMS's detector layers\cite{CMS:1994hea}. Particles first encounter the tracker, which is composed of several layers of silicon pixels and strip detectors. Essentially, a through-going particle leaves a cascading charge deposit that can be measured as an electrical signal. This results in an accurate measurement of the particle's position as it passes through various sections of the tracker, which can then be reconstructed to give the particle's entire trajectory. Track information provides fundamental insights like the charge and momentum of a particle, for instance, which can be inferred from the curvature of the particle's trajectory. Having passed through the tracker, particles then encounter the calorimeters, which will measure the final energies of emergent particles when possible. Energies of particles that interact by the electromagnetic force, electrons and photons, are measured by the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) while those that interact by the strong force, hadrons, are measured by the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL). Finally, particles that escape the ECAL and HCAL -- now only muons and weakly interacting particles -- encounter the muon layer, where muons are tracked further, before leaving the bounds of CMS. The presence of neutrinos, which mostly pass through the detector undisturbed, and possibly yet-undiscovered particles can only be inferred. Conservation of momentum is key here: invisible particles will show up as missing energy in comparing the sum of the measured particle momenta to the overall energy of the collision.

\begin{section}{CMS Coordinate System}

In the CMS Coordinate system, the $z$-axis is aligned along the beampipe, therefore running parallel to the barrel and perpendicular to the endcap of the detector. The $x$-axis points radially towards the center of the LHC, and the y-axis points orthogonal to $x$ and $z$. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is defined about the $z$-axis, as in cylindrical coordinates, and the pseudo-rapidity $\eta$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \eta \equiv -\ln{\bigg[ \tan{\bigg( \frac{\theta}{2} \bigg)} \bigg]}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\theta$ is the angle between the particle three-momentum and positive $z$-axis. See Figure \ref{fig:cms-coords} for a visualization of this coordinate system.
